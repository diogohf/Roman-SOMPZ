**sompz** - RAIL estimator, summarizer, and classifier using the SOMPZ method described in [Buchs, Davis, et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05005.pdf), [Sánchez, Raveri, Alarcon, Bernstein 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09542.pdf), [Myles, Alarcon et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08566.pdf) and [Campos, et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00922). 


The main product is the galaxy ensemble tomographic bin assignments and associated redshift distributions $n(z)$, which are output for a sample as a `qp` ensemble. The code additionally saves the two Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) constructed for $n(z)$ inference and assignment indices of the input galaxy samples to their respective SOMs.

The SOMPZ algorithm generates redshift distributions for a sample of galaxies with a multi-step inference formalism. Based on observations of a wide-field imaging dataset catalog and a deep-field imaging dataset catalog (traditionally lower-noise optical bands and additional near-infrared bands), the algorithm takes three primary tabular data inputs:

- `spec_data`: a catalog with secure redshifts, deep-field photometry, and simulated wide-field photometry
- `balrog_data` : a catalog with deep-field photometry and simulated wide-field photometry
- `wide_data`: a catalog with wide-field photometry

In practice, `spec_data` is a subset of `balrog_data`.

These catalogs are used to train two SOMs: one built with deep-field photometry and the other built with wide-field photometry.

Once all samples are assigned to the wide SOM and `spec_data` and `balrog_data` are assigned to the deep SOM the wide SOM cells can be grouped into tomographic bins via a tomographic binning algorithm. The redshift distributions are computed as follows:

$$ n(z|\hat{b}, \hat{s}) = \sum_{\hat{c} \in \hat{b}} \sum_{c \in \hat{c}} p(z|c, \hat{s}) p(c|\hat{c}, \hat{s}) p(\hat{c}| \hat{s}) $$

# RAIL: Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers

RAIL is a flexible software library providing tools to produce at-scale
photometric redshift data products, including uncertainties and summary
statistics, and stress-test them under realistically complex systematics.
A detailed description of RAIL's modular structure is available in the 
[Overview](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/overview.html) 
on ReadTheDocs.

RAIL serves as the infrastructure supporting many extragalactic applications 
of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory,
including Rubin-wide commissioning activities. RAIL was initiated by the
Photometric Redshifts (PZ) Working Group (WG) of the LSST Dark Energy Science 
Collaboration (DESC) as a result of the lessons learned from the 
[Data Challenge 1 (DC1) experiment](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/499/2/1587/5905416) 
to enable the PZ WG Deliverables in 
[the LSST-DESC Science Roadmap (see Sec. 5.18)](https://lsstdesc.org/assets/pdf/docs/DESC_SRM_latest.pdf), 
aiming to guide the selection and implementation of redshift estimators in DESC
analysis pipelines. RAIL is developed and maintained by a diverse team
comprising DESC Pipeline Scientists (PSs), international in-kind contributors,
LSST Interdisciplinary Collaboration for Computing (LINCC) Frameworks software
engineers, and other volunteers, but all are welcome to join the team
regardless of LSST data rights.
